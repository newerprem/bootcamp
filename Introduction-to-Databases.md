## Q2) Design Schema

### Tables:

- `customers`: Stores customer details like name, contact, and address.
- `salespersons`: Contains information about sales representatives handling orders, such as name, region, and contact details.
- `orders`: Stores individual customer orders. Each order is linked to a specific customer and assigned to one salesperson. Also records the date/time of the order.
- `products`: Represents the product catalog including product names, prices, and descriptions.
- `order_items`: Tracks which products are part of which order, including quantity and per-item price at the time of purchase. This enables detailed order history and billing.
